          Drop silly extra depends that sneaked in. It was hobbitses, and they are pesky.

1.11044404 2010-11-03 05:25:56 Pacific/Auckland
          Upgrade to recent @KENTNL changes ( remove inc/ and xt/ from source tree, relocate perlcritic.rc )
          Now have a convenience function, usable by all consuming roles that permit filtering packages
            that match criteira added to MetaNoIndex. Once your role uses this function, the attribute
            also bolted on by this change ( meta_noindex = 1 ) will control this behaviour.
            Thanks to xdg/David Golden for this suggestion.

1.11034201 2010-07-25 01:35:56 Pacific/Auckland
          Forked into 4 smaller dists to reduce the installation overheads.
          Mostly so that people who want Metaprovides::Package don't have to install MooseX::Declare and friends.
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Package
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Class
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile

1.10034117 2010-07-24 17:37:49 Pacific/Auckland

          Dropped xt/author/kwalitee.t to avoid the needless dep.
           ( Kwalitee Test plugin doesn't have this issue )

1.10027802 2010-05-23 01:08:02 Pacific/Auckland
          Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL
            ( Yeilding more accurate t/ depends )
          Removed =inc::Dist style loopback in favour
            of the more reliable and more generic
            =inc::lib

1.10027518 2010-05-20 17:33:10 Pacific/Auckland
          Upgraded tests to Dist::Zilla 2.x. ( should resolve rt #56482 )
            ( Thanks to DAXIM/Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ 迪拉斯 for reporting )
          Upgraded dist.ini to Dist::Zilla 2.x

1.10001919 2009-09-12 06:17:57 UTC
          Dropped the version dep on FindBin because it causes
           problems for some. Apparently deping on something that 
           may or may not be in core which may or may not be in core
           later is a bad thing. 
          Added CompileTests
          Add dist.ini to release for diagnostic reasons.

1.10000417 2009-08-28 04:52:32 UTC

          Documentation Upped on the plugs.

1.0920022 2009-07-19 22:52:48 UTC
          Moved Documentation to a .pm
              file to satisfy Module::Build
