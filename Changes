 [Features]
 - Reverted all non-documentation changes since 1.13x. Handling this in the

 - Reworked Changes to CPAN::Changes spec.
 - Made critic happy and stricter.

 [Tests]
 - add CPAN::Changes tests.
 - remove portability tests.

1.12044806 2010-11-06T18:20:55Z
 - A little bit more testing of the codebase, tests should be now
   comprehensive enough to detect most change-bugs.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.12044803, see Changes.deps{,.all,.dev} for
   details
 - test: +1

1.12044803 2010-11-06T15:26:58Z
 - Build ourself using MetaNoIndex to hide corpus/ crap.
 - Add MetaNoIndex to suggest lists.
 - Fix tests not to fail when there is no MetaNoIndex.
 - PerlTidy allover.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.12044518, see Changes.deps{,.all,.dev} for
   details
 - develop: +2
 - runtime: +1
 - test: +1

1.12044518 2010-11-04T06:32:54Z
 - Spliced Test deps into its own module.
 - Shipped work behind _try_regen_metadata to
   Dist::Zilla::Util::EmulatePhase
 - meta_noindex is now *ON* by default. This behavioural change is reason
   for Bumping the minor to 12. Rationale: If you're using MetaNoIndex and
   this module, then you want things to get skipped. With provides =>, cpan
   won't do any indexing itself, so no_index in the data does nothing. So,
   this module brings that power back to life by implementing it manually.
 - Add thanks while I remember.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.11044405, see Changes.deps{,.all,.dev} for
   details
 - runtime: +1 -2
 - test: +1 -4

1.11044405 2010-11-02T17:04:51Z
 - Drop silly extra depends that sneaked in. It was hobbitses, and they are
   pesky.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.11044404, see Changes.deps{,.all,.dev} for
   details
 - test: -3

1.11044404 2010-11-02T16:25:56Z
 - Upgrade to recent @KENTNL changes ( remove inc/ and xt/ from source
   tree, relocate perlcritic.rc )
 - Now have a convenience function, usable by all consuming roles that
   permit filtering packages that match criteira added to MetaNoIndex. Once
   your role uses this function, the attribute also bolted on by this
   change ( meta_noindex = 1 ) will control this behaviour. Thanks to
   xdg/David Golden for this suggestion.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.11034201, see Changes.deps{,.all,.dev} for
   details
 - develop: +3
 - runtime: +2
 - test: +9

1.11034201 2010-07-24T13:35:56Z
 - Forked into 4 smaller dists to reduce the installation overheads.
 - Mostly so that people who want Metaprovides::Package don't have to
   install MooseX::Declare and friends. ::Plugin::MetaProvides,
   ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Package, ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Class,
   ::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile

 - Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL ( Yeilding more accurate t/

 - Upgraded tests to Dist::Zilla 2.x. ( should resolve rt #56482 ) ( Thanks
   to DAXIM/Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ 迪拉斯 for reporting )
 - Upgraded dist.ini to Dist::Zilla 2.x

1.10001919 2009-09-12T06:17:57Z
 - Dropped the version dep on FindBin because it causes problems for some.
   Apparently deping on something that may or may not be in core which may
   or may not be in core later is a bad thing.
 - Added CompileTests
 - Add dist.ini to release for diagnostic reasons.

1.10000417 2009-08-28T04:52:32Z
