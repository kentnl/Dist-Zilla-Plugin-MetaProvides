Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-MetaProvides

1.11034201 2010-07-25 01:35:56 Pacific/Auckland
          Forked into 4 smaller dists to reduce the installation overheads.
          Mostly so that people who want Metaprovides::Package don't have to install MooseX::Declare and friends.
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Package
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Class
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile

          Dropped xt/author/kwalitee.t to avoid the needless dep.
           ( Kwalitee Test plugin doesn't have this issue )

1.10027802 2010-05-23 01:08:02 Pacific/Auckland
          Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL
            ( Yeilding more accurate t/ depends )
          Removed =inc::Dist style loopback in favour
            of the more reliable and more generic
            =inc::lib

            ( Thanks to DAXIM/Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ 迪拉斯 for reporting )
          Upgraded dist.ini to Dist::Zilla 2.x

1.10001919 2009-09-12 06:17:57 UTC
          Dropped the version dep on FindBin because it causes
           problems for some. Apparently deping on something that 
           may or may not be in core which may or may not be in core
           later is a bad thing. 
          Added CompileTests
          Add dist.ini to release for diagnostic reasons.
