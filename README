NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides - Generating and Populating 'provides'
    in your META.yml

VERSION
    version 1.15000001

SYNOPSIS
    In your projects dist.ini

        [MetaProvides::Class]
        inherit_version = 0    ;optional flag
        inherit_missing = 0    ;optional flag
        meta_noindex    = 1    ;optional flag

        [MetaProvides::Package]
        inherit_version = 0    ;optional flag
        inherit_missing = 0    ;optional flag
        meta_noindex    = 1    ;optional flag

        [MetaProvides::FromFile]
        inherit_version = 0     ;optional flag
        inherit_missing = 0     ;optional flag
        file = some_file.ini    ;mandatory flag
        reader_name = Config::INI::Reader ;optional flag
        meta_noindex    = 1     ;optional and useless flag

    And then in some_file.ini

        [Imaginary::Package]
        file = lib/Imaginary/Package.pm ;mandatory flag
        version = 3.1415                ;optional flag, subject to rules in dist.ini

DESCRIPTION
    This Distribution Contains a small bundle of plugins for various ways of
    populating the "META.yml" that is built with your distribution.

    The initial reason for this is due to stuff that uses MooseX::Declare
    style class definitions not being parseable by many tools upstream, so
    this is here to cover this problem by defining it in the metadata.

COMPONENT SUMMARY
  "::Class"
    Scans Dist::Zilla's ".pm" files and tries to identify classes using
    Class::Discover.

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides::Class

  "::Package"
    Scans Dist::Zilla's ".pm" files and tries to identify more traditional
    packages using a combination of Module::Extract::VERSION and
    Module::Extact::Namespaces.

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides::Package

  "::FromFile"
    In the event both of the above don't work for your needs, pull in
    hand-crafted metadata from a specified file.

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile

OPTION SUMMARY
  "inherit_version"
    At the time this plugin runs to collect metadata from files, the mungers
    won't have run yet to inject custom versions into files in the various
    locations.

    If you want the versions reported in the "provides" list to be
    consistent with the ones actually in the files, you will need to use
    this option in its enabled state.

    IE: Generally, if you are using version munging, you WILL want this flag
    set to 1.

   "values"
    *   '0'

        Do not inherit version from "Dist::Zilla"

    *   '1' [default]

        Inherit version from Dist::Zilla

    "inherit_version" in Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider::Provider

  "inherit_missing"
    If for whatever reason you want to actually use the versions found in
    the modules where present, and fall back to the value from Dist::Zilla.

    "inherit_version" will need to be turned off (0) for this to be
    effective.

   values
    *   '0'

        Do not inherit version from "Dist::Zilla" when one is missing.

    *   '1' [default]

        Inherit version from Dist::Zilla when one is missing.

    "inhert_missing" in Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider::Provider

  "meta_noindex"
    This dictates how to behave when a discovered class is also present in
    the "no_index" META field.

   values
    *   '0' [default]

        "no_index" META field will be ignored

    *   '1'

        "no_index" META field will be recognised and things found in it will
        cause respective packages to not be provided in the metadata.

    "meta_noindex" in Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider::Provider

  "file"
    ( Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile )

    This is a mandatory parameter that points to the file that contains
    manually ( or otherwise ) crafted metadata to be integrated into your
    final META.yml

    File Must exist.

  "reader_name"
    ( Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile )

    This parameter is by default Config::INI::Reader, but it can be in fact
    anything that meets the following criteria.

    *   Can be initialized an instance of

    *   has a read_file method on the instance

    *   read_file can take the parameter 'file'

    *   read_file can return a hashref matching the following structure

            { 'Package::Name' => {
                'file' => '/path/to/file',
                'version' => 0.1,
            }}
